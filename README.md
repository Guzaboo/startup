### Assignment: Simon HTML
From this assignment, I learned how to make a website take you to another page when you submit a form. I also learned some SVG tools, such as the circle tag. Additionally, I got some practice using div tags to add separation between elements.

### Assignment: Simon CSS
From this assignment, I got some valuable practice using the bootstrap framework to style a page. I also got practice with flex and grid and responsive design techniques.

### Assignment: Simon JavaScript
It's pretty neat how easy it is to use localStorage to save/access data across pages. It's also nice how easy it is to load and play audio files. It really does seem like it was built for web programming!
